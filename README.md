# ascii-image-converter
A simple script to convert an image to a 2-D array of ascii characters.
Depends on PIL being installed.

  -The first command line argument is the name of the image file to convert. Works best on .png files. 
  e.g., to convert the image file "dog.png" run "python convert.py dog.png"
